**Personalized License Plates for the Pocket**

Say goodbye to "Sir"  
Say goodbye to "Ma'am"  

Sell with Hello to every customer by name  
   - not their sex  
   - not their gender  
   - not their privates  

Rethink Privacy. Recognize and Remember like Royalty to achieve Loyalty  

The **No Batteries Required** Fixed Mobile Public Private App  
 -- just like a the license plate bolted to the bumper of your car  
 -- but without the taxes, tickets, and towing

People advertise who they are  
and what they want  
to employees that need help  
recalling appropriate customer preferences  
using passive RFID stickers the size of band-aids.

Customers turn on businesses when businesses turn them on.

Correlate corporate logos with customer's 3rd places,  
where everybody knows your name and they're glad you came.

Providing customers with their "Usual"  
across all corporate and franchise operations
while calling their name like  
their mother did to come to dinner 
creates habitual purchases.

Opting out after recognition like a rock star  
means going back to anonymous is an easy 12-step process.
